The approximately 14,000 dead are made up of 4,400 Ukrainian soldiers, 6,500 pro-Russian separatists and 3,100 civilians. Almost all of them died in 2014 and 2015, by the way, and under 300 in the following years.

The civilians were not all victims of attacks and of drones and missiles fired by Ukraine against the pseudo-republics. In fact, probably more than half died in separatist attacks in the parts of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts that remained under Ukrainian control.

298 civilians died when the MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a Russian surface-to-air missile fired by separatists in the DPR. The shooter only recently demanded that Russia only shell residential areas and destroy Ukrainians.

And what about the more than 30,000 that Russia has killed since February 2022? Now even proven by the UN to have deliberately shelled, tortured, raped and deported 900,000 to 1.6 million 4- to 82-year-old civilians.
